# @infinite-canvas-tutorial/ecs

This repository contains the core module code for the Infinite Canvas Tutorial project.
After lesson 17, I've used ECS to refactor.

It needs to be used in conjunction with `@infinite-canvas-tutorial/webcomponents`.

## Features

-   Entity Component System (ECS) architecture.
