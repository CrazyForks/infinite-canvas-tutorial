# @infinite-canvas-tutorial/ui

It needs to be used in conjunction with `@infinite-canvas-tutorial/ui`.

Since lesson 17, I've used ECS to refactor. So its code won't be updated since then, you can refer to `@infinite-canvas-tutorial/webcomponents` for latest code.

## Getting Started

```ts
import '@infinite-canvas-tutorial/ui';
```

Use in HTML:

```html
<ic-canvas></ic-canvas>
```
